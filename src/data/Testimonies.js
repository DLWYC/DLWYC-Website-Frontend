    testimonial: `I was hesitant to go for the camp, but a friend made me go at any cost and it ended up being one of the best experiences of my life. I made some amazing friends, and I felt like I was part of a community that truly cared about me.

The camp was a time of spiritual renewal for me. I felt like I was able to connect with God in a deeper way, and I was inspired to live out my faith in a more intentional way, all thanks to the speakers last year`,
